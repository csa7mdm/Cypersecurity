# Cybersecurity Agent Platform (Cypersecurity)

An autonomous, AI-driven cybersecurity platform for network scanning, vulnerability analysis, and remediation orchestration.

## Core Capabilities
- **Scan Planning**: Generates multi-step security assessment strategies.
- **Protocol Analysis**: Deep inspection of WiFi (802.11), Bluetooth, and IP networks.
- **Vulnerability Analysis**: AI-powered interpretation of scan results and CVE mapping.
- **Remediation**: Orchestrated response and security hardening.

## Technical Stack
- **Rust Core**: Memory-safe, high-performance collectors and scanners.
- **Go Gateway**: Distributed API orchestration via gRPC and REST.
- **Python Brain**: Agentic reasoning using OpenRouter (OpenAI-compatible SDK).
- **React Dashboard**: Live visualization and command interface.

## AI Interaction Guidelines
- **Discovery**: Use the Brain service (Python) for reasoning tasks.
- **Execution**: Use the Gateway (Go) for resource management and data retrieval.
- **Safety**: Honor the built-in kill switch (`POST /api/v1/emergency/stop`) and confirmation flows.
